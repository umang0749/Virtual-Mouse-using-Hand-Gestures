# Virtual-Mouse-using-Hand-Gestures
The Virtual Mouse using Hand Gestures is a computer visionâ€“based system that replaces the traditional mouse with a touchless, gesture-controlled interface. Using only a webcam, the system tracks hand movements in real time and maps them to cursor movements on the screen, eliminating the need for any physical input device.
